Duration: 2 hours

Objective
Brief: 
Cyber Security involves various techniques that helps in securing various digital components, network, data & various computer systems from unauthorised access.

Cyber Attacks

1. Malware (short for malicious software) is any software that is intentionally created to harm, exploit, or gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, or data.
Unlike normal software, malware is designed with harmful purposes such as stealing information, spying on users, disrupting systems, or making money for the attacker.

Common types of malware include:

Viruses — attach themselves to files and spread when those files are shared
Worms — self-replicating programs that spread across networks
Trojans — appear legitimate but secretly perform harmful actions
Spyware — secretly monitors user activity and collects data
Ransomware — locks files or systems and demands payment to restore access
Adware — floods devices with unwanted ads (sometimes used for tracking)

Signs of malware can include unusual slowdowns, unfamiliar programs appearing, pop-ups, or unexpected network activity.

2. A phishing attack is a type of cyberattack where someone tries to trick you into revealing sensitive information — such as passwords, credit card numbers, or login details — by pretending to be a trustworthy person or organization.
Phishing usually happens through emails, text messages, fake websites, or social media messages that look legitimate. The attacker’s goal is to make you click a malicious link, download an attachment, or enter your information into a fake login page.

3. A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is a cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.

In a MITM attack, the attacker positions themself between the sender and receiver — for example, between your device and a website or Wi-Fi network — so they can:
Eavesdrop on messages or data
Steal sensitive information (passwords, banking details, session cookies)
Modify messages before they reach the other side
Common ways MITM attacks happen
Unsecured public Wi-Fi (attackers create fake hotspots or sniff traffic)
HTTPS spoofing or certificate manipulation
Session hijacking (stealing login tokens)
ARP spoofing on local networks
DNS spoofing (redirecting to fake websites)

Others: 
4. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): Hackers gaining access to a network for a prolonged time in order to gain access to information.
How APTs work:
Attackers recon the target, gathering information about systems, employees, and processes.
They gain access using phishing, malware, or vulnerabilities.
They move laterally within the network to reach sensitive data.

They exfiltrate data slowly to avoid detection or manipulate systems for sabotage.
5. Distributed Denial of Service Attack- Multiple systems of a company used to lunch an attack which renders the services of that organisation hanging.
Depriving services to be handled.
6. SQL injection - Hacker gaining access to and altering sql codes to change, add or delete stuff in a database table. 

In all; 
1. Malware → malicious software–based attack
2. Phishing → social-engineering attack (tricks people into giving information)
3. Man-in-the-Middle → network-based interception attack

Network Security Control:

1. Firewall: 
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of rules.
Its main purpose is to block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication between devices and networks.

You can think of it like a security guard for your network; it decides which data packets are safe to let in or out.

Types of firewalls

Network firewalls — protect entire networks (often built into routers)
Host-based firewalls — installed on individual devices like laptops or servers
Hardware firewalls — physical devices used in organizations
Software firewalls — programs that run on computers or servers
Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) — include extra features like intrusion detection and application filtering

What a firewall helps protect against;

Unauthorized access from hackers
Malware spreading over the network
Suspicious or harmful traffic
Certain types of network attacks

2. HoneyPots
A honeypot is a cybersecurity defensive control.
It’s a decoy system or resource intentionally set up to look real (like a server, database, or login portal) so that attackers are lured into interacting with it.
The goal is to detect, study, and monitor malicious activity without exposing real systems.
You can think of it as a trap for attackers.

What a honeypot is used for;
Detecting intrusions and suspicious behavior
Studying attacker techniques, tools, and tactics
Diverting attackers away from real assets
Supporting threat intelligence and research
