Objective
Brief: 
Computer Hardware: The physical aspects essential for running a computer. 

7 essential parts of the Computer:
1. Case or Chasis-Protector case for the components

2. RAM - (Random Access Memory or Memory)-Stores same kind of data like the hard drive. Sacrifices storage space for instant access to information.
So small storage, large access. If harddrive has about 1000gigabyte of storage space, the RAM has about just 16gigabytes.
RAM has most stuff that are constantly in use.

3. Motherboard - A circuit board where all the componets are connected and communicates with one another.

4. Power Supply- A power outlet where power supply is connected for computer to be switched on.

5. CPU- (Central processing Unit or Processor)- Very low data. processes data like reading, arranging and running programs.
More like the brain or central part of the computer.
CPU pulls data that is needed to be used from the hard drive and stores it in the RAM so that it can be accessed and processed easily.
That is why when a game is started, you see loading. It is loading that game or the level of that game from the hard drive onto your RAM,
for processing to begin for the game to start

7. Harddrive- (Storage) - All data is stored here. Stores large data but has slow access to these data.
That is why RAM is needed. So Large storage, reduced or slow access to information. Stores data that is not constantly in use.

8. Graphiscs card - (Graphics Processing Units): 
When all the binary codes are being converted from 1s and 0s to meaningful information, Eg, playing a video game or watching a movie,
the graphics card works by converting it to a better quality.
It figures out what pixels need to light up on the screen, in what colour and at what time.
To throw more light;
When a video gave is being played, the data of the video game or the level is spooled from the
hard drive, placed into the storage of the RAM and with ease of access is processed by the CPU. The motherboard can display the 
graphics but it wont be as clear as when the graphics card steps in to display at the right resolution where it decides which pixel to use, light
up and at what time it is supposed to show.


Environment / Tools
- Browser, TryHackMe AttackBox (Linux Fundamentals-Ubuntu)
- Commands used:

Command	Description
1. echo	: Output any text that we provide
2. whoami	: Find out what user we're currently logged in as.

if a single word, no double quote. Eg. Echo Hello
If a string of words, use double quotes. Eg. Echo "Hello lovely world".

Navigating commands:
Command	Full Name
ls	listing
cd	change directory
cat	concatenate
pwd	print working directory
find Eg. Find -name note.txt or find -name +.txt
grep Search for file values or values. Eg. wc -l access.log (to find entries of say web server)

Operators:
Symbol / Operator	Description
&	  This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
> 	This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>  This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
