Duration: 2 hours

Objective
Brief: Understand CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and types of threat actors.

Environment / Tools
- Browser, TryHackMe AttackBox
- Commands used: (none for this theoretical session)

Notes / Steps
- Confidentiality = Protection places on private information from unauthorised access.
- Integrity = Prevention of unauthorised changes made to confidential and private information to maintain authenticity. 
- Availability = Providing authorised access to private information to only authorised users.
- Script kiddie = A hacker with no significant programming knowledge. 
- Risk = A combined measure of vulnerabilities, threats and impact of cyber attacks for a given system.
- Vulnerability = Potential weak points in a security system.
- Threat - Likelihood of a given attack.
- Impact - Consequences of an attack.
- Zero day exploit - Vulnerability exploited before any body else found it out.


- Example: Stuxnet attack story.


Defensive Notes / Remediation - How to decrease vulnerability on your system ( personal mobile, laptop, etc.): 
1. Enabling 2-factor authentication.
2. Reduce the likelihood of an attack. (The more people stand to gain from you, the more likely you are to an attack.
3. Reducing potential impact of an attack: Back-up.
4.
